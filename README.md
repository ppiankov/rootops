# RootOps

**RootOps is the practice of operating on root causes, not symptoms.**

RootOps focuses on:

- preventing irreversible actions upstream  
- removing dangerous execution paths entirely  
- enforcing capability boundaries *before* runtime  
- designing systems where **nothing happening is success**  
- assuming uncontrolled propagation of data and minimizing its semantic value  
- reducing trust requirements through structural constraints, not discipline  

**Trust is not assumed. It is derived.**  
Data that must travel should arrive incomplete by design.

RootOps is not:

- observability  
- SRE  
- incident response  
- dashboards  
- postmortems  
- heroics  

If a system requires vigilance, training, or constant attention to stay safe,  
RootOps considers it **already failed**.

Security is not detection.  
Safety is not response.  
Control is not trust.

**Principiis obsta.**
